Getting Started with ChildCount+
================================

Before you "get started," make sure to take a look at
the :ref:`intro__should_you_use` section of the
introduction.
If you are duly convinced that you need some CC+ action in
your life, then read on.

.. _tech__prereqs:

Technology Prerequisites
------------------------

.. warning:: ChildCount+ should NOT be deployed on 
             a publicly accessible network.
             Data between the server and clients is
             not encrypted the software is not hardened
             against attacks.

.. tip:: Wait! Before you read on, check out the 
         :ref:`human__prereqs` section.
         Make sure that you're not missing anything on the human
         side of things before you jump into the land of
         config files and list comprehensions.

All Installs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Linux Server
    You will need a server to host your ChildCount+
    installation. 
    We recommend using Ubuntu versions 10 and up, 
    since that is what we use for development and deployments.

Printer
    If you need to print paper reports.

SMS-Based Installs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GSM Modem
    If you want to interact with ChildCount+ via SMS.
    Any modem that works with `PyGSM <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygsm/0.1>`_
    will work.
    We use Multitech MTCBA-G-F4 modems.

SMS-Enabled Mobile Phones
    One per community health worker.

Mobile Phone Chargers
    If you are deploying in an area without reliable
    power, make sure you have solar chargers or some
    other means of charging cell phones.

Airtime Credit Distribution System
    You will need some way to distribute airtime
    credit to the community health workers.
    Millennium Villages Project has tried to 
    negotiate with mobile operators to get 
    toll-free SMS lines, but distributing
    airtime scratch cards by hand is also
    an option.

Understanding the Components
-----------------------------

The ChildCount+ stack is large -- it includes many 
components patched together in non-obvious ways.
The following diagrams will hopefully give you a
sense of what the components of ChildCount+ are
and how they relate to each other.

| **Web**                        |  .. image:: /images/tech/web.jpg       |
 * *Cherokee Web Server* handles incoming
    HTTP requests and passes them to...

 * *django_wsgi.py* -- a Python script that
   sets some environment variables (like 
   the local time zone) and invokes Django's
   uwsgi handler.

 * *Django*'s Web framework handles the
   request from there.
