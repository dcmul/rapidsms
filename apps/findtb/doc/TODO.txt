TODO : Create a page for sref featuring pending tests
like a board with a colum per test and the list of sputum at this stage

TODO : if we add submenu, it would be good to separate dashboards menu from submenu
like 
EQA dashboard | Sref dahboard                                 sref pending tests
-------------   -------------                                 ------------------
But where to put the search ?

TODO : use the patient name instead of the specimen number in sref
Careful : if there is no name, use the number. In search, put "Add a name to the patient"
button if there is no patient.

TODO : in search, they should be able to enter either a location, a patient name
or an id.
