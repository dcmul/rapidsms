Human Prerequisites
-------------------

.. warning:: Even the simplest mobile health
             platform will probably require a full-time or near-full-time
             manager to keep it running and to integrate it into 
             your existing health program.
             Do not spend time and money deploying a mobile health
             system if you do not have the human resources to 
             make it useful!

Community health workers
    ChildCount+ is a tool for community health workers to
    keep track of their patients and for health managers
    to keep track of their community health workers.
    ChildCount+ is not a general data collection tool
    (for that, see `ODK <http://opendatakit.org/>`_)
    nor is it a tool that would be very useful for
    clinicians or for general-purpose medical record keeping
    (for that, see `OpenMRS <http://openmrs.org/>`_).

Programmers
    Running ChildCount+ requires access to a software
    developer or at least a systems administrator.
    The more programming talent you have at your disposal,
    the more flexible and useful ChildCount+ will
    become.
    `FrontlineSMS <http://www.frontlinesms.com/>`_ might
    be a good alternative solution for organizations without
    programmers at their disposal.


Community Health Worker Program
-------------------------------

Since we designed ChildCount+ for the 
`Millennium Villages Project <http://www.millenniumvillages.org/>`_,
we have incorporated elements of the MVP CHW protocols into
the ChildCount+ forms, alerts, and reports.
