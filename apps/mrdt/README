Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test Reports
RapidResponse includes an SMS health report for malaria rapid diagnostic tests (MRDT), an effective way of
quickly diagnosing malaria in a patient at the household level. MRDTs are used whenever a child presents with a
fever to diagnose whether or not malaria, a major killer in children, is at the root of the child’s illness.
Besides collecting the results of the MRDT test, the care provider is able to report whether or not a bed net is
available at the household of the patient. The MRDT report shares the common pool of symptom codes available to
the malnutrition report.
If the patient tests positive for malaria, RapidResponse provides a Coartem dosage recommendation based on the
patient’s age. If the patient is a child under five and the result is negative or presents with any of the risk symptoms,
RapidResponse will refer the child immediately to a clinic for further evaluation.
MRDT reports start with the form code MRDT and follow the following syntax:
MRDT +28 Y N D CV
and would return:
Child +28, DIALLO Fatimata F/13M has MALARIA. Child is less than 3.
Please provide 1 tab of Coartem (ACT) twice a day for 3 days.
