Malnutrition Monitoring Reports
Community‐based Management of Malnutrition (CMAM) is based on the principle of using field based health care
staff to monitor malnutrition in children through frequent home visits. CMAM uses two primary indicators to check
for malnutrition: a MUAC (mid‐upper arm circumference) measurement and an edema (swelling) check. In addition,
health care workers are also trained to look for specific risk symptoms that pose significant danger to a child
suffering from malnutrition which include: diarrhea, vomiting, chronic cough, high fever and unresponsiveness.
A malnutrition report starts with a MUAC form code and follows the following syntax:
An SMS report for a non‐malnourished child would have a MUAC over 125 with no edema would look like:
MUAC +26 140 n
and would return:
MUAC> Child is not malnourished. +26 DIALLO F. F/13M (Amie). MUAC 140 mm
