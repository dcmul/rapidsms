System Components
-----------------


..rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] **Why the +?** We call our system ChildCount+ 
    (read: "Child count plus") because it has expanded from
    a system for collecting data about children to a system
    for collecting data about people -- including adults.
    The "+" represents the fact that we count children *and*
    adults too.
