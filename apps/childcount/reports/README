|| Intro ||
This describes the ChildCount+ reports framework.
The purpose of the framework is to make it quick
and easy to add new reports to a ChildCount+ 
installation though it's still not as quick and
easy as it might be.

There are two types of reports:
1) Nightly reports -- generated every night at midnight
   using a Celery task.  You DO NOT need to create a 
   task yourself, this is handled by the reports
   framework.
2) On-demand reports -- generated when a user visits
   the URL for that report.  You DO NOT need to 
   create a urls.py entry or a view for your report.
   That is handled by the reports framework.

The code for creating either type of report is the
same so that it's easy to change a report from one
type to another.

|| Todo ||
- i18n on all reports
- transition last reports to the framework

|| Installing Reports ||
For starters, you need to add two Configurations
to your ChildCount+ database with keys:
"ondemand_reports" and "nightly_reports" (no quotes)

Each of these should contains a whitespace-separated
list of modules that are in the folders:
    apps/childcount/reports/ondemand
        * and *
    apps/childcount/reports/nightly

For example if you have a nightly report in a file
called DeathAuditReport.py, you would put that
file in:
    apps/childcount/reports/nightly/DeathAuditReport.py
and add "DeathAuditReport" to the value of the
Configuration entry that has key "nightly_reports."
