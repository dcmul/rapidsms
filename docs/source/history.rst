History
-------

.. warning:: This history is probably incorrect. 
             It is based on one ChildCount+ team member's fuzzy recollection
             of conversations with other team members.

ChildCount+ v1 came out some time in 2009.
`Matt Berg <http://www.buildafrica.org/>`_ along with
David Gelvin, Dickson Ukanga, and Renaud Gaudin
deployed the software at the Millennium Villages Project
Sauri site.
The v1 software was a sort of `Twitter <http://www.twitter.com/>`_
clone for community health workers -- they could message
each other and send broadcast messages as well.
There were some features for recording patient health
data as well.

This same team started to develop ChildCount+ v2 in 2010.
This second version of ChildCount+ (the current version as
of June 2011), developed the health data collection
features and added report generation functionality as 
well.

MVP deployed the v2 software at Sauri in early 2010
and at other MVP sites in mid-2010. 
Sauri's community health workers were able to interface
with the ChildCount+ system from the v1 deployment
onwards.
Community health workers at most other
MVP sites still (as of June 2011) 
interact with ChildCount+ via paper forms.
